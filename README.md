WRSEL
=====

Function for computing estimates under a Weighted Rank Squared Error Loss function, with the option of parallelising intensive computations. Please see the accompanying notebook http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/andrewzm/WRSEL/blob/master/ipython/WRSEL_Example_1.ipynb and (after having read the notebook!) the associated RShine application at https://andrewzm.shinyapps.io/WRSEL_example/ for an explanation of WRSEL and an interactive toy study.

This package is still under development and is not available on CRAN. To install you will need to have `devtools` installed and loaded. Then type in  `install_github('andrewzm/WRSEL')`. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any queries.
